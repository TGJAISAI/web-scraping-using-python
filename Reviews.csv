5,"It's not pro, it's 13 pro max.I switched from 6s to 13 pro max.Ultimate performance as expected bcz A15 bionic processor is at its best.Camera is just amazing as triple camera with sensor shift motion and night vision.Video recording in night mode with cinematic mode is just cute ever.Display:-Wooww as 120Hz is just super smooth, gives you ultimate gaming experience. You will hang on but your iPhone won't. Battery is long lasting too but you may be notüòâüòâüòúüòú.Front camera is a...READ MORE"

20,Great phone from Apple. Excellent display with variable refresh rate. Feels very light on hand. Great battery stand by time. Amazing delivery speed by Flipkart.

25,Amazing product. An absolute charm to use the 120hz refresh screen on an Apple device running ios 15. Battery life is superb. Powerful processor never slows down even on heavy tasks.  Only downside is the weight slightly heavy. Rest an amazing product from Apple.  Reliable service from Flipkart.READ MORE

40,"I've never owned an iPhone and wanted to transition over after I heard about the spectacular battery life of the 13 Pro Max. I finally pulled the trigger and got it. Now coming to the phone, it's nothing short of amazing. It was a pretty easy transition but that may be because of the fact that I still have an android lying around when I need it. If you're sceptical of getting the phone on Flipkart, don't be. It's a genuine iPhone and the open box delivery system is quite neatThe only down...READ MORE"
